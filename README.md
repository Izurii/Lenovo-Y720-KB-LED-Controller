# Lenovo-Y720-KB-Led-Controller

This software controls the backlight of Lenovo Legion Y720 Keyboard on Linux, as the Lenovo didn't make the drivers/software for Linux.

It works mostly the same as the Lenovo Nerve Center, including the global hotkey of **Fn+Space** to change between profiles created by the user.

Here a screenshot:
